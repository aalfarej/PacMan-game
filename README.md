# PacMan-game
Get a image of a pac man and move it around with the arrow keys: first step
Big Picture:
The big picture for this game is basically recreating the clasic and fmaous pac man game. I will be adding a pac man logo that will be able to move up, down, left, and right by using the control keys. The game will also consist of think rectyangular blocks that will create a maze for pac man to move around in. The game will also provide little dots scattreed around the maze that the pac man can eat. My project will be a recreation of everything provided in the clasicall pac man game. 

First Steps: 
My first step for this project is obciouly to get a pac man image or logo to pop up in my screen. Then I would want to obviously make it move all times of directions around the screen.My second steps I would want to achive is like what I stated before, I would like to provide think rectablgular shaps scatterwd around the screen to make a maze for the pac man.

Testing: 
There is not much to really test with my project. Only way to check if it is working is obviosuly making sure that the game is playing correctl. Which is by moving around pac man and sucesfully eating up the poonts that are scattered aroung the screen. In order to ofically check and test that the project is working. There will also be a "game over" aspect to the game. When the pac man gets eaten by the enemies, the game will end and provide a page that will ask the user if they want to play again or not.These are the simple aspects to test if my project is fully working anf succesfull
